- Reusability (once a function is defined, it can be used over and over again) and abstraction (even though you may not know how the function works inside, you can still use it)
- def <name of function>((optional) arguments):
    code
    (optional) return
- To use a function, you need to call it. Eg. sum_two_numbers(2,3)
- The return statement causes your function to exit and hand back a value to its caller. Considering why we use it, the main purpose of a function is to have a value returned to the user after all (i.e making it a fruitful function).
- We do not have to use return in every function, but I guess it's advisable.
- Function arguments/parameters are the values we send to the function so that it can do whatever it needs to do with them. To do that, we put them inside the brackets when we call the fuction.
- To use functions from other files, we need to import said files.
